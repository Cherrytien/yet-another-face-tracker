# Yet Another Face Tracker

This is a pretty dumb project using face_recognition to label specific faces 
in real time on live video.  Just drop images of specific people to detect
into the `/images/` directory in `.jpg` format and they will be labeled by 
the file name on the live video when you run `app.py`.
